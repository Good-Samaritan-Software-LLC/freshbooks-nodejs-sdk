# Examples and Sample Code

This directory contains examples and sample code for using FreshBooks with the SDK (`@freshbooks/api`).

If you checkout the project, these files should be runnable locally after installing.

```shell
yarn build
yarn install
node ./examples/authorization_flow.js
```

Be sure to update the example files with your own credentials in place of `<your account id>` and `<your access token>`.
